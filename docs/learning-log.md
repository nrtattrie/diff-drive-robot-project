# Learning Log

A record of progress, learnings, resources used, and challenges throughout the project.

### Day 1 - Friday, January 16, 2026

**What I Did:**
- Ordered NVMe SSD for Raspberry Pi 5 ($38)
- Installed VS Code with Robot Developer Extensions for ROS 2
- Watched Articulated Robotics videos 1-6 (ROS 2 intro series) (https://www.youtube.com/@ArticulatedRobotics)
- Read ROS 2 core concepts documentation (nodes, topics, services)
- Created GitHub repository with proper structure
- Organized project files (GitHub, Google Drive, OneNote)
- Started BOM tracking

**What I Learned:**
- ROS 2 uses DDS for decentralized communication (no ROS master needed like ROS 1)
- Nodes communicate via Topics (pub/sub), Services (req/resp), or Actions (long-running tasks)
- Differential drive robot kinematics: v = (vL + vR)/2, ω = (vR - vL)/L
- The importance of project organization from day one

**Key Insights:**
- Building a "standard" differential drive robot is necessary but not sufficient for standing out
- Need to add unique elements after mastering basics
- My mechanical engineering background is a significant advantage over CS-only candidates

**Challenges/Questions:**
- How exactly does Nav2 costmap work? (Will learn in Month 2-3)
- What's the actual torque requirement for my motors? (Need to calculate once robot designed)
- GoodNotes pricing changed, using OneNote instead

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Get access to Raspberry Pi 5
- Install Ubuntu 22.04 Server
- Install ROS 2 Humble
- Complete first 4 ROS 2 tutorials
